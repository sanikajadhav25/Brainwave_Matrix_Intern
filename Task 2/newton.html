        <h1>Isaac Newton</h1>
        <h2>Physicist, Mathematician, and Astronomer</h2>
        <p>Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English physicist, mathematician, and astronomer who played a key role in the Scientific Revolution. His groundbreaking discoveries in physics and mathematics laid the foundation for classical mechanics.</p>
        
        <h2>Major Contributions</h2>
        <p>Newton’s most significant achievements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Formulation of the three laws of motion, which describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it.</li>
            <li>Discovery of the universal law of gravitation, explaining planetary motion.</li>
            <li>Development of calculus, which revolutionized mathematics and engineering.</li>
            <li>Experiments with optics, leading to a better understanding of light and color.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Newton’s work in physics and mathematics continues to influence science today. His laws of motion and gravitation remain fundamental in understanding the universe, and his contributions to calculus shaped modern mathematics.</p>
