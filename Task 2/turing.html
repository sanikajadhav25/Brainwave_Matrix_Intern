        <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
        <h2>Mathematician, Computer Scientist, and Cryptanalyst</h2>
        <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst who played a crucial role in the development of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He is best known for his work on breaking the German Enigma code during World War II.</p>
        
        <h2>Major Contributions</h2>
        <p>Turing’s most significant achievements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing the concept of the Turing machine, which became the foundation of modern computer science.</li>
            <li>Leading the team at Bletchley Park that cracked the Enigma code, significantly aiding the Allied war effort.</li>
            <li>Writing the seminal paper on artificial intelligence, introducing the Turing Test.</li>
            <li>Contributing to the development of the first stored-program computers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Alan Turing is widely regarded as the father of computer science. His work laid the foundation for artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and computational theory. Today, the Turing Award is considered the Nobel Prize of computing.</p>
